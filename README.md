# Java Training 

Java Training is a series of exercises that will allow you to practice Java Fundamentals (datatypes, control flow and testing). In the SEA, we will use these exercises for Dojos. You will have the possibility to automatically test the code of each exercise.

## Objectives

* Train the Java Fundamentals of the 3rd week
* Develop and Run code and Tests in the IDE
* Learn how analyze errors by reading error logs and stacktraces

## Preparation

* Clone this repository
* Switch to branch *dojo-sea-fundamentals*

### Verify the Setup of the Project in your IDE

First step before starting the exercise: check that everything is in place to work.

In IntelliJ, you should see this project structure (in the "project" tab):

``` bash
.
├── lib
│   ├── hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
│   └── junit-4.12.jar
├── logs
├── README.md
├── src
│   ├── exercices
│   │   └── PrimitiveTraining.java
│   │   └── ...
│   └── tests
│       ├── MainTest.java
│       └── PrimitiveTrainingTest.java
│       └── ...
└── tester.sh

```

## Validation criteria

* The code compiles without errors
* The code passes all the expected validations
* The code respects the Java conventions (indentation, naming of variables, classes, methods, etc...)
